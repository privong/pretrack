# Pre Track

GPS logging scripts from the [Palm Pre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Pre).
Released under the GPLv3 and posted for posterity.

This was the original data collection method I used for recording GPS locations.
This data collection eventually inspired the [magellan](https://github.com/privong/magellan) project, to analyze the GPS data.

## Scripts

I forget the exact usage now, but I believe some of these were set to run periodically with a `cron` job.

* `palm_track-email.sh`
* `palm_track-textlog.sh`
* `palm_track-transfer.sh`
* `textlog.sh`
